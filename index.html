    <div id="about">
        <p>I am currently getting a bachelor's in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics</p>
        <p>The programming languages I am familiar with are: Python, Java, C++, C#, and JavaScript</p>
        <p>A specific programming paradigm that I am intrigued by is test-driven development</p>
        <p>A field of Computer Science that I would like to learn and eventually help develop is quantum computing</p>
        <p>In spite of my interests, I am down for just about any kind of computer project, including making a website</p>

            <h4>Math Notes</h4>
            <p>Below is a collection of my math notes so far</p>
            <p>Note it is far from finished, I am currently working on geometry</p>
            <p>I plan on getting all of my other notes compiled eventually.</p>
            <aside><strong>Note</strong> brackets [] mean that the words were either illegible or didn't make sense in its
                context so my current understanding would be inside the brackets, and a question mark (?) means I have
                no idea what it meant</aside>
