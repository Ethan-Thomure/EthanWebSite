For the math notes...
    -   Finish Geometry math notes
        -   fix the (?)
        -   Add more and better pictures
        -   add definition for similar (~), then add links to this where it says "similar"
        -   add definition for leg and hypotenuse, then add links to this where it says "leg" (specifically for a triangle)
        -   add definition for mean proportional, then add links to this where it says "mean proportional"
        -   add definition for secant, then add links to this where it says "secant"
        -   add definition for base, then add links to this where it says "base"
        -   add another definition for altitude for other shapes, namely parallelogram, then look back through the mentions of altitudes and link to correct definition
        -   add definition for "subtend"
        -   add definition for circumscribe
        -   add definition for sector
        -   add proper links and revamp "notes"
    - Add more Math notes (Maybe Precalculus next)
